### project title: HUFFMAN CODING 
## task:
Restrict your alphabet to 6 letters {a, b, c, d, e, f} and construct the sequence of 300 symbols e.g.
abacefddcabbdedacffaeebdfcabeafbdcab … using the following probability distribution :

Pb(a)=0.05, Pb(b)=0.1, Pb(c)=0.15, Pb(d)=0.18, Pb(e)=0.22, Pb(f)=0.3.

Show Huffman coding and decoding of the stream and compute the average length of codewords, what is a compression ratio ?

Discuss what happens (compression ratio) if „suddenly“ the probability is changed so that Pb(a)=0.3 and P(f)=0.05. You use the same Huffman encoding for the above fixed distribution which is not optimal in this case


# instructions for LLM: 
Use Google for material on LZW compression scheme and for other techniques as well, though developing own code might be easier.
